# Magento 2 Multi Flat Rates extension

Native Magento 2 only supports one shipping flat rate which can lead to difficulty for stores in defining the best price for delivering products to customers in different countries.  

**Multiple flat rate shipping** is a must have for many online stores, especially international brands which deliver their products worldwide. Offering buyers different flat rates to select makes shopping easier and convenient for customers. Besides, this also helps stores manage shipping methods better.

### 5 multiple flat rate shipping

**Mageplaza Multi flat rate shipping extension** allows store admins to add up to 5 other shipping rates. Admins are free to give a shipping flat rate a name and/or a title to help buyers distinguish it with others on Cart page and Checkout page. 

Each flat rate can be turned on/off easily on the backend. A set of configuration options for price, sort order, applicable countries, and error message are also ready to be selected.

### Sort multi flat rates neatly

As a store may want to have more than only one flat rate shipping, multiple rates should be in a certain order. Admins can choose this order by sorting every shipping rate on the backend. 

### Multi flat rate visibility

Each flat rate shipping can be applied on a restricted number of countries or all allowed countries depending on the settings on backend. 

Admins can multiple select countries to allow buyers in those countries to choose a specific shipping flat rate.

Buyers who are not in applicable countries will not be allowed to select that shipping flat rate. In this case, admins can set an error message to inform buyers. This message can be enabled/disabled and changed easily on the backend.
